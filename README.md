# Conceptual Topology Mapping Benchmark

A novel LLM benchmark testing whether models have consistent, measurable geometric structure in how they navigate between concepts.

## The Idea

Give models two concepts, ask for intermediate waypoints, and test whether the resulting paths reveal consistent topological structure. Unlike static embedding analysis, this benchmark evaluates *behavioral navigation* — do models traverse conceptual space with predictable "gaits"?

**Builds on:** [Word convergence game](https://github.com/jamesondh/word-convergence-game) — 575 games across 4 models showing characteristic navigational patterns, semantic basins of attraction, and direction-dependent behavior.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY to .env

# Single waypoint elicitation
bun run index.ts --model claude --from music --to mathematics --waypoints 5

# Run with multiple repetitions
bun run index.ts --model gpt --from "Beyoncé" --to erosion --reps 10 --format semantic
```

## Experiment Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Select prompt format (runs on holdout pairs)
bun run prompt-selection          # ~1200 API calls
bun run prompt-selection --dry-run  # Preview without running

# 2. Run main pilot experiment (runs on reporting pairs)
bun run pilot                     # ~2480 API calls
bun run pilot --dry-run           # Preview

# 3. Analyze results and generate findings
bun run analyze
bun run analyze --skip-embeddings  # Skip semantic similarity (no API calls)

# 4. Phase 2: Reversal experiment (runs reporting pairs in reverse + polysemy supplementary)
bun run reversals                 # ~960 API calls
bun run reversals --dry-run       # Preview
bun run reversals --concurrency 12  # Faster with higher concurrency

# 5. Analyze reversal results
bun run analyze-reversals
```

## What It Measures

- **Intra-model consistency** — How stable are waypoints across repeated runs? (Jaccard, positional overlap, distributional entropy)
- **Cross-model comparison** — Do different models produce structurally different paths?
- **Waypoint count effect** — Do 5-waypoint and 10-waypoint paths share structure at different resolutions?
- **Control baselines** — Identity pairs (trivial), random pairs (noise floor), nonsense (hallucination detection)
- **Polysemy steering** — Do ambiguous words (bank↔river vs bank↔mortgage) produce clearly different paths?
- **Directional asymmetry** — Is the path from A→B the same as B→A? (Phase 2: permutation tests, bootstrap CIs, direction-exclusive waypoints)

## Concept Pairs

36 pairs across a stratified matrix:

| Category | Example | What it tests |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Anchor | Beyoncé↔erosion | Known basin structure from word-convergence |
| Hierarchy | animal↔poodle | Hypernym↔hyponym navigation |
| Cross-domain | music↔mathematics | Bridging unrelated fields |
| Polysemy | bank↔river vs bank↔mortgage | Sense disambiguation via context |
| Near-synonym | cemetery↔graveyard | Dense neighborhood friction |
| Antonym | hot↔cold | Continuum navigation |
| Controls | apple↔apple, nonsense strings | Baselines |

## Models

Four models via OpenRouter: Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.2, Grok 4.1 Fast, Gemini 3 Flash. Same core models as word-convergence-game rounds 4-5.

## Stack

- **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) (TypeScript)
- **LLM API:** [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (multi-model access)
- **NLP:** [compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) (lemmatization)
- **Embeddings:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-large via OpenRouter

## Status

**Phase 1 complete.** 2,480 runs across 4 models and 21 pairs. Key finding: models have distinct conceptual gaits (2.2x consistency gap between Claude and GPT).

**Phase 2 implemented.** Reversal experiment ready to run — tests directional asymmetry (A→B vs B→A) with permutation tests, bootstrap CIs, and category-level predictions. See `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for the full plan.
